Log Levels
----------

MLForge Python APIs log information during execution using the Python Logging API. You can 
configure the log level for MLForge logs using the following code snippet. Learn more about Python
log levels at the
`Python language logging guide <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger("MLForge")

    # Set log level to debugging
    logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
